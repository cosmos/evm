  "summary": "## EpixChain v0.5.4 Upgrade\n\n### IBC Wallet Compatibility Fix\nFixes IBC transfer signature verification for Keplr and Leap wallet users. IBC v10's MsgTransfer proto includes extra fields (`use_aliasing`, `encoding`) with `dont_omitempty` annotations that cause the chain's amino encoder to produce sign bytes different from what wallets generate. The fix adds a fallback that strips these extra fields during signature verification, allowing wallet-signed IBC transfers to succeed.\n\n### Minimum Validator Self-Delegation\nSets a minimum validator self-delegation requirement of **1,000,000 EPIX** to ensure validators maintain meaningful stake in the network."
