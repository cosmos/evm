  "title": "EpixChain v0.5.4 IBC Wallet Fix + Min Validator Self-Delegation",
  "summary": "This upgrade includes two changes: (1) Fixes IBC transfer signature verification for Keplr and Leap wallet users. IBC v10's MsgTransfer proto includes extra fields (use_aliasing, encoding) with dont_omitempty annotations that cause the chain's amino encoder to produce sign bytes different from what wallets generate. The fix adds a fallback that strips these extra fields during signature verification. (2) Sets a minimum validator self-delegation requirement of 1,000,000 EPIX to ensure validators have meaningful stake in the network."
